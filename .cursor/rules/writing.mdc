# Writing Rules for Markdown Content

Apply these rules when editing or creating markdown files in this repository.

## No Vague Hand-Waving

Avoid phrases that sound meaningful but say nothing:

- ❌ "X flips this around"
- ❌ "The real power comes from..."
- ❌ "do some incredible things"
- ❌ "This is where X shines"
- ❌ "provides the plumbing"
- ❌ "bridges the gap"
- ❌ "unlocks new possibilities"

## No Marketing Speak or Hype

Avoid superlatives that sound like you're trying to sell:

- ❌ "game-changing"
- ❌ "revolutionary"
- ❌ "powerful"
- ❌ "seamless"
- ❌ "robust"
- ❌ "cutting-edge"
- ❌ "best-in-class"
- ❌ "almost limitless possibilities"
- ❌ "This powerful plugin"

This is educational content, not a sales pitch.

Use plain terms instead of jargon:
- ❌ "portability" → ✅ "use the same tools in different applications without rewriting code"
- ❌ "separation of concerns" → explain the concrete benefit or delete it

## Don't describe anything as easy

- ❌ "this simple prompt"


## Every Sentence Must Say Something Concrete

If a sentence can be deleted without losing information, delete it:

- ❌ "This topic has been on my mind for some time"
- ❌ "The challenge is making that connection"
- ❌ "Let's dive in"

Be specific about mechanisms:
- ❌ "Dashboards require learning a new tool"
- ✅ "Dashboards require knowing which filters to apply and which charts to read"

## If You Claim Something, Explain How It Works

Don't make claims without explaining the mechanism:

- ❌ "The knowledge graph resolves ambiguity by letting the model ask clarifying questions"
- ✅ "When the model queries the graph and finds multiple matching profiles, it can list the options and ask the user which one they mean"

## Be Honest About Limitations

- Don't overstate what a system does
- ❌ "years of experience" when you mean "definitions for abbreviations"
- Acknowledge when something won't be perfect

## Don't Try to Be Clever

Avoid quips and wordplay that don't add information:

- ❌ "Natural language requires... talking"
- ❌ Ending sections with clever one-liners

## No Negative-Then-Flip Pattern

Don't start with what something isn't, then flip to what it is:

- ❌ "It's not about X - it's about Y"
- ❌ "This isn't replacing analysts. It's giving them a better way to share what they know."

Just state what it is directly.

## No Em-Dashes

Use commas, periods, or restructure the sentence instead:

- ❌ "The model queries the graph—finding multiple profiles—and asks the user"
- ✅ "The model queries the graph, finds multiple profiles, and asks the user"

## Formatting Preferences

- Prefer sentences over bullet points when content flows naturally
- Use code examples to show concrete implementations
- Use mermaid diagrams to illustrate flows and relationships

## Each Word Has a Purpose

Before including a sentence, ask: "What specific information does this add?"

If the answer is "it sounds good" or "it's a nice transition", delete it.
