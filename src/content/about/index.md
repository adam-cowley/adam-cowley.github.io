From my first professional development job back when the internet was built with `<table>`s, I have been building websites, mobile apps and mobile applications.

I'm a digital technologist born and raised in [Swindon, Wiltshire, UK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swindon). Throughout my career, I have worked across the tech sector doing everything from building websites and mobile apps to consulting with some of the worlds largest companies.

In 2017, I joined [Neo4j](https://neo4j.com) as a Field Engineer/Professional Services Consultant and have since travelled across Europe, training users to be successful with Neo4j and contributing to projects for everyone from startups to household companies.

Currently, I work as **Manager of Developer Education** at [Neo4j](https://neo4j.com), leading the team behind [GraphAcademy](https://graphacademy.neo4j.com) - Neo4j's free learning platform.

Away from the computer, I am a sports fan - in particular I enjoy [watching (and analysing) football](/posts/analysing-football-events-neo4j), playing snooker and pool.
