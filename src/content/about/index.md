From my first professional development job at 14, back when the internet was built with `<table>`s, I have been building websites, mobile apps and mobile applications.

I'm a 30-something digital technologist born and raised in [Swindon, Wiltshire, UK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swindon).  Since my first professional project at 14, I have worked across the tech sector doing everything from building websites and mobile apps to consulting with some of the worlds largest companies.

In 2017, I joined [Neo4j](https://neo4j.com) as a Field Engineer/Professional Services Consultant and have since travelled across Europe, training users to be successful with Neo4j and contributing to projects for startups to household companies.

During the day I work as a **Developer Advocate** at [Neo4j](https://neo4j.com), teaching Developers and Data Scientists how to build applications through [GraphAcademy](https://graphacademy.neo4j.com).

Away from the computer, I am a sports fan - in particular I enjoy [watching (and analysing) football](/posts/analysing-football-events-neo4j), playing snooker and pool.
