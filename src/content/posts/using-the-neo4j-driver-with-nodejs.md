## Whoa?! Where did this content go?

This post was originally posted in 2018, things have changed a lot since then.

Since taking over [Neo4j GraphAcademy](https://graphacademy.neo4j.com/courses/app-nodejs/?ref=adam), I have published [comprehensive developer focussed Neo4j courses](https://graphacademy.neo4j.com/category/developer/?ref=adam) on [Building Neo4j Applications with Node.js](https://graphacademy.neo4j.com/courses/app-nodejs/?ref=adam) and [Building Neo4j Applications with Node.js](https://graphacademy.neo4j.com/courses/app-typescript/?ref=adam).

I would suggest taking a look at these courses.
